This tool parses a markdown description of a user journey and generates a beautiful, interactive flowchart visualisation (HTML+SVG) for teams building large platforms.

## Features
- Parse journeys with personas, events, and capabilities from markdown
- Render as a flowchart (using Mermaid.js)
- Each event is a node with title, description, and optional icon
